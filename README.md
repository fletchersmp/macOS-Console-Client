A lightweight AFK Console Client designed specifically for **macOS users**.  

This client is optimized for stability and ease of use, so you can AFK in Minecraft without keeping the full game running. Save system resources, and run multiple accounts at once.

## About The Project 

Most existing Minecraft AFK clients are Windows-only or require complex technical setup. Many macOS players are left without an easy option. **This project was built to fill that gap.**


## Getting Started


## Acknowledgments

This project is heavily inspired by AFK Console Client developed by Valoks. However, their free program only works on Windows. I highly recommend you check out their amazing project â€” they also offer a paid web/cloud based client which also allows you to AFK 24/7 on any device.
