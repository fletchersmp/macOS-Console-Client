# macOS-Console-Client

![screenshot](docs/images/macos_preview.png)

A lightweight AFK Console Client designed specifically for **macOS users**.  

This client is optimized for stability and ease of use, so you can AFK in Minecraft without keeping the full game running. Save system resources, run multiple accounts at once, and keep your sessions alive effortlessly.



## About The Project 

This project is heavily inspired by AFK Console Client developed by Valoks. However, their free program only works on Windows. I highly recommend you check out their amazing project â€” they offer a paid version which works on all devices from your web browser.

Most existing Minecraft AFK clients are Windows-only or require complex technical setup. Many macOS players are left without an easy option. **This project was built to fill that gap.**


only provides a Java Edition client for Windows, but not macOS. This project is inspired by their intuitive design and will allow you to join and AFK on Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition servers on macOS.


The Minecraft AFK Console Client was developed due to the lack of a Console Client with an intuitive user interface. Most Minecraft players are casual or non-technical, unfortunately most clients require technical knowledge and time to set up. That's why we made the client. It's intuitive and fast.

Minecraft takes up a lot of your resources, so running the AFK Console Client instead will save you a lot of resources and allow you to AFK with a lot of accounts simultaneously. Furthermore, the client offers a single interface for controlling all of your accounts at once.

As requested, we've also made a web/cloud based client which also allows you to AFK 24/7 with your computer closed. You can check that out [here](https://minecraftafk.com/web) or read more about it just below.
